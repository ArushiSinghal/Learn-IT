# Learn-IT
Project of Learn IT, Girl. <br />
Objective of the project is to search "Image by content".<br/>
‘content based’ search has been proposed which analyzes the content of the image. System will allow user to upload a particular image and depending on combined values of color, shape and texture, the system will retrieve similar images from database. <br />
The system incorporates techniques for upload and search of images over large datasets of images based on the content of the images rather than the keywords and tags or any other textual information. <br />
Traditionally, search of the images are using text, tags or keywords or annotation assigned to the image while storing into the databases. Whereas if the image which is stored in the database are not uniquely or specifically tagged or wrongly described then it’s insufficient, laborious and extremely time consuming job for search the particular image in the large set of databases. for these purpose obtaining the most accurate result CBIR (Content-based image retrieval) system are used which searches and retrieve the query images from the large databases based on their image content like color, texture and shape which derived from the image itself.
