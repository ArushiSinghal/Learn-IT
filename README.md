# Learn-IT
Project of Learn IT, Girl. <br />
Objective of the project is to search "Image by content".<br/>
‘content based’ search has been proposed which analyzes the content of the image. System will allow user to upload a particular image and depending on combined values of color, shape and texture, the system will retrieve similar images from database. <br />
The system incorporates techniques for upload and search of images over large datasets of images based on the content of the images rather than the keywords and tags or any other textual information.
